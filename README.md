### 🤗 Hello! I'm Runze Ouyang, but you can call me Chloe. With a growth mindset and a passion for stepping outside my comfort zone, my journey has been nothing short of transformative.
### 🙌 I possess a solid background in software engineering, having experience in both full-stack and mobile application development. I am actively seeking a full-time, entry-level software engineer position commencing in September 2024. I am confident in my capability to meet and surpass any challenges that come my way in my professional journey.
### 👩🏻‍🎓 While completing my four-year undergraduate business degree at Babson, I had the distinct privilege of joining the founding team of a social media application. There, I witnessed the awe-inspiring evolution of an app from its initial concept to its growth, amassing over 10,000 users. This experience fostered a profound admiration for the magic of code.
### 👩🏻‍💻 Driven by the belief that determination can help me achieve anything, I pivoted from a business background with a resolve to delve into coding. I initiated this transition by pursuing a master's program in Data Analysis, where I was introduced to coding and excelled with a 4.0 GPA. Further fueling this passion, I embarked on learning Java, fully committing myself to the path of becoming a software developer.
