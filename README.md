* 🤗 Hello! I'm Runze Ouyang, but you can call me Chloe. With a growth mindset and a passion for stepping outside my comfort zone, my journey has been nothing short of transformative.
* 🙌 I possess a solid background in software engineering, having experience in both full-stack and mobile application development. I am actively seeking a full-time, entry-level software engineer position. I am confident in my capability to meet and surpass any challenges that come my way in my professional journey.
* 👩🏻‍🎓 My undergraduate degree is from Babson College, the #1 ranked business school for entrepreneurship. Among my multiple entrepreneurial experiences, my mobile app startup experience not only exposed me to the transformative power of technology but also ignited my desire to be at the forefront of creating impactful digital solutions. I successfully launched a social media platform that garnered over 10,000 users without promotion. This experience fostered a profound admiration for the magic of code.
* 👩🏻‍💻 I decided to switch to programming from zero. In my first year of a big data-related master's degree at NYU, I earned a consecutive 4.0 GPA. In my second year, I moved towards becoming a software programmer and took many computer-related courses. I have a strong learning ability and am curious about new technologies. My background in business, combined with my technical skills in Java, JavaScript, React, Spring Boot, etc, will help the company develop better products and enhance user experiences.
